  [[https://travis-ci.org/stakemori/ob-sagemath][https://travis-ci.org/stakemori/ob-sagemath.svg]]

  ob-sagemath provides an [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org-babel]] integration with [[http://www.sagemath.org/][SageMath]] by [[https://github.com/stakemori/sage-shell-mode][sage-shell-mode]].
  This package is inspired by [[https://github.com/gregsexton/ob-ipython][ob-ipython]],
  though the implementation is completely different.

** Requirements
   1. SageMath 6.6 or newer.
   1. GNU Emacs 24.3 or newer.
   1. [[https://github.com/stakemori/sage-shell-mode][sage-shell-mode]]

** Installation and sample configuration
   You can install =ob-sagemath= from [[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa.git][MELPA]].
   =ob-sagemath= requires [[https://github.com/stakemori/sage-shell-mode][sage-shell-mode]].
   See [[https://github.com/stakemori/sage-shell-mode#installation-and-setup][Installation and Setup]] to setup [[https://github.com/stakemori/sage-shell-mode][sage-shell-mode]].
   The following is a sample configuration for =ob-sagemath=. Put these lines in your "~/.emacs.d/init.el".

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Ob-sagemath supports only evaluating with a session.
  (setq org-babel-default-header-args:sage '((:session . t)
                                             (:results . "output")))

  ;; C-c c for asynchronous evaluating (only for SageMath code blocks).
  (with-eval-after-load "org"
    (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") 'ob-sagemath-execute-async))

  ;; Do not evaluate code blocks when exporting.
  (setq org-export-babel-evaluate nil)

  ;; Show images when opening a file.
  (setq org-startup-with-inline-images t)

  ;; Show images after evaluating code blocks.
  (add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'org-display-inline-images)
#+end_src

** Example file
   Here is an example org file.

   [[file:./example.org][example.org]]

** Session
    ob-sagemath currently supports only evaluating with a session by using [[https://github.com/stakemori/sage-shell-mode][sage-shell-mode]].
    So like in the sample configuration, you have to provide the =:session= header argument.
    Usually, code blocks are evaluated in the =*Sage*= process buffer.
    If the =:session= argument is provided and it is a string, then the code block is evaluated in
    another process buffer.
    For example, by evaluating the following code block, a process buffer =*Sage<foo>*= is created and
    the code block is evaluated in the process buffer.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC  sage :session foo
    print 'This code will be evaluated in the process buffer *Sage<foo>*.'
  ,#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Asynchronous evaluation
   You can evaluate SageMath code blocks by =C-c C-c= (bound to =org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c=) like in other org-babel packages.
   But usually it blocks user inputs. In the sample configuration, =C-c c= is bound to =ob-sagemath-execute-async=.
   And it enables the asynchronous evaluation. So you can interact with Emacs during the evaluation.
   With a prefix argument, it evaluates all code blocks in a buffer.
   If the =org-mode= buffer is killed during the evaluation, the output will be lost.
   Please do not kill the =org-mode= buffer until the evaluation completes.

** Images
   Images of 2d graphs can be embedded by providing the =:file= header argument.
   By evaluating the code block, the image file is stored in the file.
   Here is an example.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC sage :file sin.png
    # You can change the size of the image by providing the figsize argument.
    plot(sin, [0, 2*pi], figsize=4)
  ,#+END_SRC

  ,#+RESULTS:
  [[file:sin.png]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

   If the =:file= header argument is not provided and the =:results= header argument contains =file=,
   then the code block returns a temporally file name.
   SageMath deletes these temporally files when the process exits.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC sage :results file
    plot(sin, [0, 2*pi])
  ,#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE


** Tables
   If the =:results= header argument contains =table= and the output looks like a table
   (a list/tuple of lists/tuples), then the result is converted to a table.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC sage :results table :colnames '(Fruit Price)
    [("Apple", 300), ("Banana", 200), ("Orange", 300)]
  ,#+END_SRC

  ,#+RESULTS:
  | Fruit  | Price |
  |--------+-------|
  | Apple  |   300 |
  | Banana |   200 |
  | Orange |   300 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Kill evaluation
   To kill the evaluation, switch to the process buffer (usually its buffer name is =*Sage*=),
   and hit =C-c C-c= (bound to =sage-shell:interrupt-subjob=).
